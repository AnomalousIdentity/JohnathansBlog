As a lucky individual who has perfect pitch, I often hear comments and wonderings about it. For those interested, here are some common myths I've heard and my responses to them.

## Question 1: Can you identify the note any object produces?

Answer: Mostly yes.

For sounds coming from instruments, it's easy for me to accurate identify the pitch and fine tune an instrument without the help of a tuner. For random sounds such as a clap or the flicking of an object, it depends on how clean the sound is; sometimes the sound can have multiple pitches in which case I cannot identify a singular pitch associated with that sound. Otherwise, it's intuitive to me what pitch is associated with a clean sound.

## Question 2: Has identifying any note always been intuitive since birth?

Answer: No.

Honestly, I don't think it's possible for someone to associate notes with specific pitches with a blank slate. The pitches we now assign notes aren't naturally found; a C4 is only 261.6 Hertz because many musicians came together and decided that pitch was pleasing. Unless I learn what exact pitch should be associated with what exact note, there's no way for me to identify C4 without knowing what it's supposed to be. Perfect pitch simply makes me more sensitive to sounds than normal people and be able to accurately identify notes.

I had experimented with listening to pitches out range of common instruments; I wasn't able to identify notes past a certain point since I've never heard a note that high/low and have no knowledge of what note is associated with that pitch.

## Question 3: What are the benefits of perfect pitch?

Answer: Increased efficiency in practicing.

After starting to compete in competitions, I noticed that musicians of similar levels are required to practice much more than I do. Fine-tuning a piece and making it sound nice comes more naturally for me, which significantly reduces the amount of time I need to practice. It's easier for me to recognize elegant sounding patterns and can definitely be of great help if I had chose the path to become a music producer.

## Question 4: Does perfect pitch have a spectrum? Can it be improved?

Answer: Likely yes.

Familiarity with music can definitely improve perfect pitch. From being able to intuitively identify any note and being able to identify any chord takes time. Although I was able to hear multiple pitches out of a chord at the start, it was still difficult to remember which notes were in the chord since they were played in unison. It takes familiarity with every note to be able to develop a muscle memory and identify the notes of a complex chord. However, I've always had this sensitivity with notes so I don't think there is a spectrum between having and not having perfect pitch.

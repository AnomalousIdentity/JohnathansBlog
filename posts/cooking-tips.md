As a self-proclaimed connoisseur of Chinese food, I yearn for a good Chinese restaurant to open up in my city. In the meantime, however, I can make my own food and here's some tips to level up your cooking game too.

## Tip 1: Improving your stir-fried dishes

The key to having a stir-fried dish that has flavorings evenly distributed throughout yet still being tender is to quickly flip the wok with the aid of a spatula or spoon. This is referred to as 颠勺 in chinese. By repeating a pushing and pulling motion, the sauce is able to evenly distribute through the food without the risk of it being overcooked. This is crucial for fried rice where no two grains stick together and meat dishes where the meat is still tender. This method is used when the temperature in the wok is high; there's no use in tossing the food in the air if it's not hot.

For everything to stir fry evenly, you also need to chop food into even pieces so they are all cooked at the same rate.

## Tip 2: Improving your rice game

There's big differences between what type of rice to use for what type of dishes. The more amylose and less amylopectin a rice has, the less sticky and more dry it is. Rice with more amylose also tend to be longer. For dishes where you want each grain to separate such as fried rice, it's recommended to use rice with more amylose such as jasmine rice. For general use of rice, usually most rice found in supermarkets are in this category. For dishes where you want rice to fully stick together such as 八宝饭 or 糍饭团, it's recommended to use gelatinous or sticky rice.

Now, usually the propotions of water to rice to put in a rice cooker is 1:1. You can reduce the proportion of water by 10% for harder rice, but it's recommended not to increase the proportions of water to avoid it becoming a semi-congee.

## Tip 3: Improving your dough game

Chinese 面点, or dough-related food making is arguably the most difficult. It's not possible to go into details here, but be sure to knead the dough until it is smooth with no cracks. This type of cooking takes the most time and experience, so don't be discouraged upon a couple failures. Some beginner dishes I recommend to start off with is 韭菜盒子, 千层肉饼, and 手擀面. Try it out if you have time!
